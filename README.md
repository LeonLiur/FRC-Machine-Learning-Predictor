# FRC-Machine-Learning-Predictor
This project attempts to use descriptive, holistic data collected by [Team 610](http://team610.com/) during the 2022 Competition RAPID REACT to predict the winner of a game.

Data is first cleaned and standardized before training a diverse set of algorithms such as Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, and KNN. A blend of the models is created to infer match outcomes.

Since only around 350 matches have been played in Ontario, the sample size is not enough to make an accurate inference or an accurate assessment of inference. More work is necessary, including access to more data.
